          The Golden Retriever is a large-sized breed of dog bred as gun dogs to
          retrieve shot waterfowl such as ducks and upland game birds during
          hunting and shooting parties, and were named 'retriever' because of
          their ability to retrieve shot game undamaged. Golden Retrievers have
          an instinctive love of water, and are easy to train to basic or advanced
          obedience standards.

          The Dalmatian is a breed of large dog, noted for its unique black
          or liver spotted coat and mainly used as a carriage dog in its early days.
          Its roots trace back to Croatia and its historical region of Dalmatia.
          Today, it is a popular family pet, and many dog enthusiasts enter Dalmatians
          into kennel club competitions.
